# pyExperiment
A few classes for highly generalizeable experiment builders

Use python 3.6+ and the newest psychopy

TODO:
  - Add support for EEG and Pupil in the Controller
  - Fix that gui for fetching subject data (running the psychopy gui method makes it all crash)
  - Fix the monitor settings
  - Add stop time option for drawAndWait()
  - Docstrings
  - Make a nice progress bar method
  - Go over the messages being logged
  - Make a log parser that summerizes everything that happened for each run
